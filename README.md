# NorthwestLabs

This MVC application contains the basic layout of Northwest Lab's new system. 

The Home Page is geared toward Northwest customers. From here customers will be able to view information about the company, browse the catalog, and view the assays the company offers.

When the customer logs in, it will enable the system capabilities that relate to their unique account. These include the ability to create a new work order, view existing work orders, see their account balance, and make a payment.

The customer login credentials are as follows:
Username: Customer
Password: Login

On the home page there is an "employee login" link that enables the site's full functionality. The employee sign in credentials are as follows:
Username: Employee
Password: Login

When an employee logs in, they will choose which office they are signing in from. Depending on which city they choose, the system will have different functionality.

The singapore office system has the ability to update/track work orders, see the schedule, view the system logs, and view the lab results.

The seatle office system has the ability to update/track work orders, see the reports from both Singapore and Seattle offices, view customer account information, and update the catalog entries.
